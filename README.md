# Spatial Simulation
Within this spatial simulation course, six assignments were completed to build expertise in ABMs using GAMA
platform. GAMA platform is very powerful and easy-to-use open-source tool for modeling and
simulating spatially explicit agent-based models. The high level programming language
GAML(GAma Modeling Language) is used for devolping the agent based models. It integrates
GIS data, supports multi-level modeling, and offers advanced visualization and analysis tools,
making it a versatile tool for GIS based applications.

The assignments included **Initialization and execution order** which emphasized on sequence of
agents initialization and execution along with learning and following best coding practices.
**Working with lists** involved analyzing lion population age demographics using list data types.
The **On the move** module different movement rules are implemented and visualized for different
species. **Grazing cows** focuses on simulating interactions between cows and grass, exploring
steady-state dynamics. A project proposal was developed to work on real application. Finally,
**visualizing and exporting results** focused on creating dashboards with maps and graphs to
interpret simulation outcomes and export results in various formats.
These assignments collectively emphasize initializing agents and environments, defining
behaviors, analyzing system dynamics, and presenting and exporting results effectively and
implementing this knowledge in real world projects.

The code (.gaml) file for each assignment is available under the models folder.
